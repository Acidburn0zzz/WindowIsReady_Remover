# WindowIsReady_Remover
Removes window is ready Notification

This removes the annoying "Windows is Ready" notification.

It disconnect the WindowAttentionHandler listenner, so you will never get that message.
This was only possible after gnome 3.18.

Tested mainly using skype, Fedora 23 with gnome 3.18
